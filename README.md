## Main Features
* You can create logic gate circuit diagrams.
* Logic gate diagrams can be simulated.
* Diagrams can be converted to equivalent boolean expressions and vice versa.
* Diagrams and boolean expression can be converted to truth tables.

## What is it for?
This is foremost an educational tool, which with the assistance of it's conversion features, should provide a helpful aid for a
student to learn about the relation between logic circuits, boolean algebra and truth tables.
